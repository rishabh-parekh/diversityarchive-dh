This collection was curated by Rishabh Parekh, a student at UC Berkeley, as a part of his Digital Humanities 150a course. It hopes to serve as a platform for individuals to educate and view important pieces of literature, articles, and images that pertain to modern social justice movements, including the 2020 black live matter movement.
