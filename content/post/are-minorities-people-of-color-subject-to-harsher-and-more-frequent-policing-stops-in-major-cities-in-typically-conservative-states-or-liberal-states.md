**Research Question**

The research topic that I chose to investigate is:

Are minorities/people of color subject to harsher and more frequent policing stops in major cities, in typically conservative states or liberal states?

### Relevance

To clarify, the terms conservative or liberal are related to their state's political ideologies. This topic is extremely relevant to our daily lives. Currently, there are protests and calls for action across the world, regarding the deaths of George Floyd, Breonna Taylor and countless others who have lost their lives due to unjust policing and racism. Slogans such as #Defundthepolice, have been trending on popular social media platforms like Twitter and Instagram. These social movements have largely been the focus of the media, therefore, with the upcoming Presidential election, it is incredibly vital for the public to have access to the data and stories of policing in their community.

There has been significant work in highlighting the lapses in criminal justice and policing through data. Efforts from universities such as The Stanford Open Policing Project, organizations such as Police Scorecard, and newspapers such as the Washington Post, routinely publish informative pieces that address whether “there’s overwhelming evidence that the criminal justice system is racist.” These contributions are extremely positive and benefits the collective good by providing continual support to solve police brutality related issues. However, my research project is slightly different, as I am focused on investigating the relationships between policing in politically leaning liberal and conservative regions. The crux of this project is to understand whether there is a strong correlation between policing, regional political ideology, and victim race.

### Assumptions

One assumption it that the state's political ideology is representative of the political ideology of the major city's police force. The funding of the police is decided by the state government and is therefore influenced by the state's political ideology. Typically, more conservative states tend to spend more on their police force.

### Materials & Methods

I used multiple datasets from the Stanford Open Policing Project ([https://openpolicing.stanford.edu/data/](https://openpolicing.stanford.edu/data/ "https://openpolicing.stanford.edu/data/")). This website provides the authentic and unprocessed datasets for crime in cities across the United States. The 4 cities that I have chosen for this project are located in states with varying political ideologies. The cities are San Francisco, Pittsburgh, Charlotte, and New Orleans. These locations were chosen because the information provided was the most complete compared to other cities listed on the website. Data contained in these csv files include the crime’s reason for the stop, its location, time, latitude, and longitude data. In addition to this, entries are also added if a citation/warning/search/arrests were made as well as the formal outcome of the reported crime (ie. if the crime ended in a citation or a warning). The subjects’ race, age, and sex are also included within the sets, which are also interesting variables to analyze across these cities for their social and political implications. I built visualizations mapping crimes in these various cities, locations, types of crime bar charts, victim race type pie charts, Twitter sentiment analysis of recent #policebrutality and #BLM activities on Jupyter, Visual Studio Code, and Twitter Developer API’s. The data is cleaned and available on CSV formats on the Stanford Open Policing Project website. In addition, I will refer to the README [https://github.com/stanford-policylab/opp/blob/master/data_readme.md](https://openpolicing.stanford.edu/data/ "https://openpolicing.stanford.edu/data/") to understand column name meanings and extra nomenclature.
